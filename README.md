# Shopr Storefront

A modern e-commerce storefront app that's built to support multiple e-commerce backends. Out of the box, a Saleor adapter is provided, which may be used as a template to develop adapters for other frameworks. This project is still in its
infancy, but you're welcome to experiment with it and give feedback and suggestions.

# Features

- Easy theming and customization using AntD token system
- Configure home page layout by stacking predefined blocks
- Integration with MeiliSearch to provide blazing fast search suggestions
- Support for Google Ecommerce analytics (GA4)

# Stack

To simplify development and to allow for easy customization, we've chosen
the following tools.

- âœ¨ Ant Design as UI framework
- ðŸ”¥ RakkasJS as vite-powered app framework
- ðŸ›  ReactJS as underlying UI technology
- ðŸª‚ Typescript for safety
- ðŸš€ React-Query as data manager

# Translating

All visible UI strings are set up in locale files to enable easy translation of the UI to different languages. Currently, only English and French (Google Translate quality) are available. Other languages will be slowly added after reaching a stable version. When that time comes, we'll likely need your help with the translations ðŸ˜‰

```bash

```

Run unit tests to make sure things are in working order.
